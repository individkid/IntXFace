Add scripted keyboard/mouse backdoor to Argument for planer.lua.
Add pierce, transform, refine, additive, subtractive to planer.lua.
Add mouse/roller scale/translate/rotate ortho/focal/normal to planer.lua.
Add vulkanCpp to planer.lua.

Sculpt mouse left button start stop or perform actions.
Right mouse buttons undo the last left mouse button.
Mouse motion or roller continues the started action.
Mouse motion or roller adjust the next perfomed action.
For example, roller increases or decreases the distance of a random cursor warp
performed after a random plane through the pierce point is added.

Augment struct Event with struct Sound,
envelopes of fundamentals harmonics amplitudes.
Augment struct Event with struct Metric,
barrycentric coordinates, press duration, facet metric, hot key.
A fundamental envelope is a 12 tone chord with some tones louder than others.
A harmonic envelope tails off to zero for the highest harmonics.
An amplitude harmonic controls attack duration decay and loudness.
Typically barrycentric coordinates adjust the fundamentals envelope,
press duration adjusts the amplitudes envelope duration,
facet metric adjusts the amplitudes envelope average,
hot key adjusts the harmonics envelope octave.
