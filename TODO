sculpt.lua share between file plane space:
 plane click keyboard transform, to file
 plane click keyboard manipulate, to space
 plane click additive subtractive, to space
 file subject object matrix, to plane
 file numeric symbolic, to space
 space numeric symbolic, to file plane

Remove EXT from Makefile. Have different all: per UNAME. Write vulkan.cpp for Dell.
Use source level ifdef for Mac vs Dell in .cpp files used on both platforms.
Change .swy to .sw, and use different target name for diffent platforms.

Make face.c (NUMOPEN) datx.c (NUMOPEN) argx.c (NUMARGX) file.c (NUMFILE) arrays into array of malloc struct.
Optimize depend.lua to build each target in separate clean directory, and copy from that directory in preference to push.
Enhance show.lua to use map from enum constant and struct name to basename, with not found a match if no basename given,
so the Share struct goes only in share.h, for example.

Replace makefile by lua script,
that loads dependency lists per target/rule,
has list of regex per target/rule,
and adds to dependency list upon regex match.

Develop Theory for coincidences as sets of hyperplane classifications.
Replace Theory by an agda proof.

Make stomp boxes that add wave with frequency multiplied or divided.
Plug in Mac Dell Digiscope Stompbox BMD Audient Roland.
Open windows for play.lua, digiscope, stopmbox, audient, roland.
Compose windows digitally and with analog slider.
