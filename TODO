Add fifo named from Argument for programmatical cursor roller button keyboard. Add initial window location and size to Argument. Test transformation of hello triangle. The same triangle and cursor screen locations should work the same with any random window location and size. For hello triangles, transform several triangles separately as well as all at once, and test manipulation of one triangle. Check that matrix changes are sent out as expected to maintain a file and topology. Add test of additive subtractive refine modes. Add test of metalSw together with fileC and spaceHs.

For Vulcan, use Update After Bind flag, and call VkUpdateDescriptorSets in the draw function. Use storage buffers instead of uniform buffers. The vertex shader main would be gl_Position = vec4(calculatePosition(gl_VertexIndex), 1.0f). To optimize, the vertex indices from Triangle would have to be packed into a VkBuffer for vkCmdBindIndexBuffers, Vertex coordinates and plane/polytope indices would have to be packed into a VkBuffer for vkCmdBindVertexBuffer, and Uniform Subject Object Element could be uniform buffers.

Convert makefile to lua script; then intermediate dependencies, like function names, could be explicit in the dependency include file; functions could be generated as needed, instead of all or nothing; platform specific files could be ignored on other platforms;  and multiple resolutions could be explicitly prioritized.

Order of completion would be: hello triangle, power supply, hello triangles, square wave circuit, oscilloscope window, sine wave circuit, space tests, saturate circuits, sculpt script, pll circuit, hdmi window, boxed circuits, play script, sound system, tetrahedron overlaps, published video, agda proof, ball script, coincidence proofs, world script, fantasy polytopes.
