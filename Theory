Undefined:
  
Boundary:
  Boundaries are like hyperplanes.

Point:
  Points are on one side or the other of the hyperplanes.

Definitions:
  
Space:
  A space is a set of boundaries {b}, points {p}, and map S from {(b,p)} to {0,1}.

Side:
  Wrt (with regard to) boundary b, points p0 and p1 are on the same side iff (if and only if) S(b,p0) = S(b,p1).

Region:
  A region is a map R from {b} of S to {0,1}.

Empty:
  A region R is nonempty iff there exists p in {p} such that R(b) = S(b,p) for all b in {b}.

Subspace:
  A space S1 is a subspace of space S0 iff the regions of S1 are restrictions of the regions of S0.

Linear:
  A space S is linear iff every subspace of S has f(n,m) = f(n-1,m-1) + f(n,m-1) nonempty regions, where n is called the dimension, m is the number of boundaries in the subspace, and f(n,0) = f(0,m) = 1.

Divide:
  If a boundary b extends space S0 to S1 then b divides region R of S0 iff there are more than one nonempty extensions of R in S1.

Section:
  A space S1 is a section of space S0 iff the regions of S1 have the same sidednesses as regions in the subspace of S0 divided by a boundary.

Simplex:
  A simplex is a space with n+1 boundaries, where n is the dimension of the space.

Opposite:
  An opposite of a region wrt a set of boundaries is the region that is the same except for the boundaries.

Apex:
  An apex region of a simplex is one that differs from the inside region by all but one boundary.

Polyant:
  A polyant is the set of regions on the given sides of a set of boundaries.

Corner:
  The corners of a polyant are the regions of the polyant that have nonempty opposites wrt the boundaries of the polyant.

Vertex:
  A vertex is a set of n boundaries in a space of dimension n.

Outside:
  An outside region is one with an opposite wrt all boundaries that is nonempty.

Cospace:
  Wrt an outside region of a space, a cospace is the set of boundaries mapped from verties of the space, such that paths from an outside region in the cospace reach boundaries in the same order as paths from the outside region in the space reach the vertices.

Hyperplane:
  In an n dimensional metric space, a hyperplane is n scalars that measure the parallel distances above n points.

Theorems:
  
Classify:
  With sidedness as above or below hyperplanes, a set of hyperplanes maps to boundaries in a linear space.

Section:
  If any two of a section, space, or extension are linear, the third is linear.
  Let S0 be a section of S1 extended to S2 by boundary b. The number of regions in S2 is the number of regions in S1 with the number in S0 divided, or |S2| = f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = |S1| + |S0|. The same applies to the subspaces.

Power:
  The number of regions in an n space with m <= n boundaries is 2^m.
  Note, f(n,1) = 2, and f(1,1) = 2. If f(n,m-1) = 2^(m-1), and f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1), then f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1) + 2^(m-1) = 2^m.

Simplex:
  The number of regions in a simplex space is 2^(n+1)-1.
  Note, f(1,2) = 2^2-1. If f(n-1,n) = 2^n-1, then f(n,n+1) = f(n,n) + f(n-1,n) = 2^n + 2^n-1 = 2^(n+1)-1.

Apex:
  A space extended by a boundary through the apex regions of a simplex is not linear.
  Suppose by recursion that the secion by one of the simplex boundaries is not linear. Then by the section theorem, either the subspace or given space is not linear. By definition, if the given space is linear, the subspace is linear. Therefore, the given space is not linear.

Independent:
  If space S extended by b0 is linear and S extended by b1 is linear, then there is a linear space extended by b0 and b1.
  Choose b in S, and assume by recursion that S0 = the section by b in S + {b0,b1} is linear, and that S1 = S + {b0,b1} - {b} is linear. Choose corner regions of b0 and b1 for b to divide in S1 such that S0 is a section of S1. Apply section theorem to find linear S2 = S + {b0,b1}.

Corner:
  Corner regions of a polyant are a section space.

Vertex:
  There is a single corner region of an n polyant in an n space.

Outside:
  From each outside region to its opposite wrt all boundaries, there are paths through nonempty regions that cross boundaries only once.

Hyperplane:
  The intersection between hyperplanes is a hyperplane constructed through the hyperplanes as points.

Sample:
  For each linear n space S there exist sets of hyperplanes {h} that classify as S.
  Given linear space {b0}, choose boundary b, and assume by recursion that the subspace {b1} = {b0}-{b} has a set of hyperplanes {h1} that classify to {b1}.
  Choose hyperplane h as a point in the cospace {h2} of {h1}. Cross hyperplanes in {h2} to move h closer to the sidedness of b, to a region r without crossable hyperplanes.
  If h does not classify to b, there must be a vertex v between h and b.
  If there is an outside region with crossable regions, start from it so r is inside. If r is an inside region, there is an n polyant p that r is a corner of not divided by v.
  If r is an outside region, use the cospace defining outside region as r. Thus, there is an n polyant p that r is a corner of, such that v does not divide p, because otherwise v would be a crossable hyperplane of r.
  Because of how p and r are chosen, there are paths in {h2} that cross each boundary of p between going past h and crossing v. In {h1}, those paths go past {v0} between crossing h and going past v.
  From p, get n vertices {v0} on same side of h and b. Construct hyperplanes arbitrarily close to n tuples of {v1} = {v0}+{v} to create a simplex with each of {v1} in its own apex region.
  By the independent boundary theorem, find linear space with b and the constructed simplex.
  Because the paths get to v after passing the constructed simplex, b divides the apex region containing v. Because the paths get to each of {v0} before passing the constructed simplex, b divides the apex regions containing those vertices.
  That b divides the apex regions of the constructed simplex violates the apex theorem. Thus h does classify to b.
