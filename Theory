Undefined:
  
Boundary:
  Boundaries are like hyperplanes.

Point:
  Points are on one side or the other of the hyperplanes.

Definitions:
  
Space:
  A space is a set of boundaries {b}, points {p}, and map S from {(b,p)} to {0,1}.

Side:
  Wrt (with regard to) boundary b, points p0 and p1 are on the same side iff S(b,p0) = S(b,p1).

Region:
  A region is a map R from {b} of S to {0,1}. A point p is said to be in region R if R(b) = S(b,p) for all b in {b}.

Empty:
  A region, R, is nonempty iff there exists p in {p} that is in R.

Subspace:
  A space S1 is a subspace of space S0 iff the regions of S1 are restrictions of the regions of S0.

Linear:
  A space S is linear iff every subspace of S has f(n,m) = f(n-1,m-1) + f(n,m-1) nonempty regions, where n is called the dimension, m is the number of boundaries in the subspace, and f(n,0) = f(0,m) = 1.

Divide:
  A boundary b of space S0 divides region R of subspace S1 iff b is not in S1, and there are more than one nonempty restrictions of R in S0.

Section:
  A space S1 is a section of space S0 iff the regions of S1 are a subset of the regions of S0.

Simplex:
  A simplex is a space with n+1 boundaries, where n is the dimension of the space.

Opposite:
  An opposite of a region wrt a set of boundaries is the region that is the same except for the boundaries.

Outside:
  An outside region is one with an opposite wrt all boundaries that is nonempty.

Base:
  A base region of a simplex is a region that differs from the inside region by only one boundary.

Apex:
  An apex region of a simplex is one that differs from the inside region by all but one boundary.

Polyant:
  A polyant is the set of regions on the given sides of a set boundaries.

Corner:
  The corners of a polyant are the regions of the polyant that have nonempty opposites wrt the boundaries of the polyant.

Vertex:
  A vertex is a set of n boundaries in a space of dimension n.

Cospace:
  Wrt an outside region of a space, a cospace is the set of boundaries mapped from verties of the space, such that paths from an outside region in the cospace reach boundaries in the same order as paths from the outside region in the space reach the vertices.

Hyperplane:
  In an n dimensional metric space, a hyperplane is n scalars that measure the parallel distances above n points.

Theorems:
  
Classification:
  With sidedness as above or below hyperplanes, a set of hyperplanes maps to boundaries in a linear space.

Section:
  A section by a linear extension of a linear space is linear.

Antisection:
  A linear space extended by a linear section is linear.

Power:
  The number of regions in an n space with n boundaries is 2^n.

Simplex:
  The number of regions in a simplex space is 2^n-1.

Base:
  The section by a boundary of a simplex is a simplex with the inside and its opposite wrt the boundary as inside.

Apex:
  A space extended by a boundary through the apex regions of a simplex is not linear.

Independent:
  If space S extended by b0 is linear and S extended by b1 is linear, then there is a linear space extended by b0 and b1.
  Choose b in S, and assume by recursion that S0 = the section by b in S + {b0,b1} is linear, and that S1 = S + {b0,b1} - {b} is linear. Choose corner regions of b0 and b1 for b to divide in S1 such that S0 is a section of S1. Apply antisection theorem to find linear S2 = S + {b0,b1}.

Hyperplane:
  The intersection between hyperplanes is a hyperplane constructed through the hyperplanes as points.

Anticlassification:
  For each linear n space S there exist sets of hyperplanes {h} that classify as S.
  Given linear space {b0}, choose boundary b, and assume by recursion that the subspace {b1} = {b0}-{b} has a set of hyperplanes {h1} that classify to {b1}. Choose a point in the cospace of {h1}, and move it across hyperplanes to make sidednesses closer to those of b, until no movement across a hyperplane makes it closer to b. If the hyperplane h does not classify to b, there must be n vertices on the correct side of h, and one vertex on the wrong side of h. Construct hyperplanes arbitrarily close to n tuples of the verties to create a simplex with the vertices in its apex regions. By the independent boundary theorem, find linear space with b and a simplex with the vertices in its apex regions. Then b divides the apex regions, violating the apex theorem. Thus h does classify to b.

Corner:
  Corner regions of a polyant are a section space.

Vertex:
  There is a single corner region of an n polyant in an n space.

Outside:
  From each outside region to its opposite wrt all boundaries, there are paths through nonempty regions that cross boundaries only once.
