Undefined:
  
Boundary:
  Boundaries are like hyperplanes.

Point:
  Points are on one side or the other of the hyperplanes.

Definitions:
  
Space:
  A space is a set of boundaries {b}, points {p}, and map S from {(b,p)} to {0,1}.

Side:
  Wrt (with regard to) boundary b, points p0 and p1 are on the same side iff (if and only if) S(b,p0) = S(b,p1).

Region:
  A region is a map R from {b} of S to {0,1}.

Empty:
  A region R is nonempty iff there exists p in {p} such that R(b) = S(b,p) for all b in {b}.

Subspace:
  A space S1 is a subspace of space S0 iff the regions of S1 are restrictions of the regions of S0.

Linear:
  A space S is linear iff every subspace of S has f(n,m) = f(n-1,m-1) + f(n,m-1) nonempty regions,
  where n is called the dimension, m is the number of boundaries in the subspace, and f(n,0) = f(0,m) = 1.

Divide:
  If a boundary b extends space S0 to S1 then b divides region R of S0 iff there are more than one nonempty extensions of R in S1.

Section:
  A space S1 is a section of space S0 iff the regions of S1 have the same sidednesses as regions in the subspace of S0 divided by a boundary or boundaries.

Simplex:
  A simplex is a space with n+1 boundaries, where n is the dimension of the space.

Opposite:
  An opposite of a region wrt a set of boundaries is the region that is the same except for the boundaries.

Apex:
  An apex region of a simplex is one that differs from the inside region by all but one boundary.

Polyant:
  A polyant is the set of regions on the given sides of a set of boundaries.

Corner:
  The corners of a polyant are the regions of the polyant that have nonempty opposites wrt the boundaries of the polyant.

Vertex:
  A vertex is a set of n boundaries in a space of dimension n.

Attached:
  A region that is a corner of a single boundary polyant and the boundary are attached.

Outside:
  An outside region is one with an opposite wrt all boundaries that is nonempty.

Migration:
  A migration is a space with a region replaced by a region opposite wrt attached boundaries.

Theorems:
  
Classify:
  With sidedness as above or below hyperplanes, a set of hyperplanes maps to boundaries in a linear space.

Section:
  If any two of a section, space, or extension are linear, the third is linear.
  Let S0 be a section of S1 extended to S2 by boundary b.
  The number of regions in S2 is the number of regions in S1 with the number in S0 divided, or |S2| = f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = |S1| + |S0|.
  The same applies to the subspaces.

Power:
  The number of regions in an n space with m <= n boundaries is 2^m.
  Note, f(n,1) = 2, and f(1,1) = 2. If f(n,m-1) = 2^(m-1), and f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1), then f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1) + 2^(m-1) = 2^m.

Simplex:
  The number of regions in a simplex space is 2^(n+1)-1.
  Note, f(1,2) = 2^2-1. If f(n-1,n) = 2^n-1, then f(n,n+1) = f(n,n) + f(n-1,n) = 2^n + 2^n-1 = 2^(n+1)-1.

Independent:
  If space S extended by b0 is linear and S extended by b1 is linear, then there is a linear space extended by b0 and b1.
  Choose b in S, and assume by recursion that S0 = the section by b in S + {b0,b1} is linear, and that S1 = S + {b0,b1} - {b} is linear.
  Choose corner regions of b0 and b1 for b to divide in S1 such that S0 is a section of S1. Apply section theorem to find linear S2 = S + {b0,b1}.

Limit:
  For each section b of space S of dimension n, there exist n vertices {v} such that no boundary or section of S divides the simplex formed by b and any v in {v}.
  This is true for simplex spaces, so assume there are vertices {v} that nothing separates b from in space S with b0 removed.
  If b0 separates b from any v in {v} replace v by the vertex formed by b0 and an edge of the simplex of v and b. Then {v} is not separated from b by boundary or section of S.

Sample:
  For each linear n space S there exist sets of hyperplanes that classify as S.
  This is true for simplex spaces, so assume there is sample space R for linear space S with b removed.
  From the limit theorem, find vertices {v}, and construct hyperplane p arbitrarily close to {v} in R, such that p has the same sidednesses as b wrt {v}.
  If p classified to some section other than b, it would violate the limit theorem, so p classifies to b.
